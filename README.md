Profiler CI kernels
===================

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This is deprecated: we [switched](https://github.com/elastic/otel-profiling-agent/pull/42) to using the [Cilium CI kernel repository](https://github.com/cilium/ci-kernels/pkgs/container/ci-kernels) directly instead.

Kernel images for use in the CI of the [OTel profiling agent](https://github.com/elastic/otel-profiling-agent).
